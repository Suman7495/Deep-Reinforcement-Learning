# Overview
This repository contains a set of popular Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms tested on OpenAI's Gym. The objective was to have simple and clear implementations.

Each folder corresponds to a particular algorithm which contains the required theoretical material to get started.

## Installation
To install the packages locally, the following steps are suggested. 
```
conda create -n RL python=3
source activate RL
git clone https://github.com/Suman7495/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning.git
cd Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
```

To run any of the algorithms, go to the specific directory and run `main.py`. For example:
```
cd COPOS
python main.py
```
Additionally, you can enter optional commands. For example:
```
python main.py --env 'CartPole-v0'
```
