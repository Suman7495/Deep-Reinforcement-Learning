# Overview
This repository contains a set of popular Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms tested on OpenAI's Gym. These are for educational purposes. 

Each folder corresponds to a particular algorithm which contains the required theoretical material to get started.

## Required packages
The following packages are required to successfully run the codes:

Python3 (version used Python3.5.2)

[OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym)

[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)

[Numpy](https://scipy.org/install.html)

[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)
