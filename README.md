# Overview
This repository contains a set of popular Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms tested on OpenAI's Gym. These are for educational purposes. 

Each folder corresponds to a particular algorithm which contains the required theoretical material to get started.

## Installation
To install the packages locally, the following steps are suggested. 
```
conda create -n RL python=3
source activate RL
pip install -r requirements.txt
git clone https://github.com/Suman7495/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning.git
cd
```
